- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohnFnc
- I'm curious behind the scenes of blockchain. I am also working. I'm doing testnet in my spare time and trying to set up Node.
- 7 months ago I made my first attempt at testnets. and I've learned a lot so far
-I've joined about 100 testnets so far. I've tested many different platforms and networks. If you want to improve yourself, you can try the node codes in my profile.
